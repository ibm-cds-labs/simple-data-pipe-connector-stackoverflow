# Simple Data Pipe connector for Stack Overflow

This connector uses the [Stack Exchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com/) to fetch the newest Stack Overflow questions for a selected tag.

The [Simple Data Pipe SDK](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/simple-data-pipe-sdk) is used to store the data in Cloudant. One JSON record is created for each question:
                                                                                          
##### Question record structure:
```json
{
  "..." : "<cloudant document properties such as _id and _rev>",
  "tags": [
    "javascript",
    "android",
    "indexeddb",
